## Proof of Concept

A proof of concept for this project works through the utilization of URL _parameters_ as a means of storing state on the front-end. This technique involves parsing the state information contained within the URL to interpret and utilize encoded data, allowing for efficient storage and sharing of content without relying on external hosting by third parties. The _immutable_ nature of this method further adds to its credibility as a viable solution.


setEncoded -> convert to URL -> user visits page -> check if query exists -> put it on codemirror
